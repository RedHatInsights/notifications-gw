# notifications-gw project

To run the application you'll need Kafka running on port 9092.
To start kafka you can use the included `docker-compose.yaml` file and use it via `docker-compose up`

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
[source,shell]
----
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
----

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
[source,shell]
----
./mvnw package
----

It produces the `notifications-gw-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
[souce,shell]
----
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
----

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/notifications-gw-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.
